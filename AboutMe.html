        <p>My name is Sepehr Hajbarat. I am currently a senior at Clarksburg High School, getting ready to graduate and move on to The University Of Maryland, Baltimore County. I intend on studying Cyber Secuirty as my major field once i get there.</p>
        <p>I created this website as a project for my programming 3 class, where I hold some of my fondest memories, such as playing halo with my classmates. We were on a never-ending journey to figure out the code behind the game and try to replicate it so we would spend days studying the code while shooting each other with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, but to no avail. The coding was far to complicated for our puny brains. So we gave up and just kept killing each other until the end of class. I would like to thank my teacher Mrs. Amberg for being so great for the 3 years I had her, although I don't really know if I can say I "had" her as a teacher in my senior year (just kidding, you did your best).</p>
