        <p>Here, we have Rahuligan typing away and doing his assignments at supersonic speed. This is apparent from the</p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>motion blur induced by the mind-blowingly insane velocity achieved by Rahul's arms. Mrs. Amberg was unfortunately not</p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>there at the moment to witness the spectacle. Unknown to most, this technique is actually the most efficient way to type </p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>code as you get the most amount of code done in the least amount of time. Study this pose as it will be taught by teachers in </p>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <p>the near future. </p>

            <p>In this photo, the mighty webmaster, Sepehr, has made a great blunder. He has left his phone unattended while</p> 
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>departing on a journey to the elegant destination known as the lavatory. When he came back, he saw his phone lying on his</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>desk. Based on his past experiences, he assumed the worst and his eyes lit up with fear. He then checked his phone and </p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>realized they couldn't unlock it so all they did was take a picture. His mind was then at rest and he lived happily ever after.</p>

            <p>Here, Rahuligan is being victimized by the great reigning terror of Pec Man. Rahul had engaged in a</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>fierce battle with Pec Man and was trying his best to come out the victor. Alas, his efforts were not </p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>rewarded. The mighty Pec Man threw a spectacularly angled flash grenade, completely decimating poor </p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>Rahul's face. It was at this moment, the master tacticion, Pec Man, swooped in and took a swift picture of his</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>foe, basking in the glory of victory.</p>
