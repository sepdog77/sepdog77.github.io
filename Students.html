        <p id="aditya"><span>Aditya Kaliappan:</span>This student has long been disguised as one of our own. He has adjusted his appearance and behavior to fit in as a "Student," but I recently uncovered his masterful disguise. Mr. Kaliappan is actually a teacher from the year of 2034 who has come back in time to be the teacher for Programming 3, Period 7 as most of the programmers in his time have been roasted too much. The reason he chose this class in particular is because they suffer from Teacher Neglect, and he has come in to be their savior. That is all the data I have been able to gather about this individual...</p>

        <p id="adi"><span>Aditya Kumar:</span>A failed clone experiment done in the future. He has also come back with Aditya Kaliappan to assist in undoing the catastrophe that occured in their time.</p>

        <p id="rahul"><span>Rahul Shah:</span>Also known as Rahuligan to some. This young individual is but a mere junior at the time of this documenting. In one week the poor soul will be all alone as all his senior friends will have departed. He is also a great competition partner as he clearly knows how to do everything and enjoys sending Scanners as parameters because THAT'S JUST SUCH A GOOD IDEA ISN'T IT.</p>

        <p id="sharvil"><span>Sharvil Parekh:</span>This man should be avoided at all costs. He approaches you with a friendly smile on his face, giving off the impression that he is a nice person. But be warned, he is a menace. He will deliver all his jokes with a completely flat and serious face and not explain it to you until you look like an idiot. I went through years of training to be able to notice when he was pulling off this signature move. He also likes to open CD drives a lot. Like, a lot. Bad boy.</p>

        <p id="chris"><span>Chris Yue:</span>Not much is known about this one. He usually keeps to himself and is seen lagging behind on assignments without asking for much assistance. He wears glasses and is apparently pretty good at Halo based on that one game he played with us so there's that I guess.</p>

        <p id="raj"><span>Hi Raj Vernmuri:</span>This student is the epitome of success. He comes into class everyday ready to work, putting in all his effort into each and every project. No matter how far and wide you search, you will never find a better student. Now that you're probably laughing, here's his real bio. This hooligan sits and watches csgo on every computer he gets his hand on and seems to not care about any of his schoolwork as he has already been denied from Montgomery College and therefore given up on life because he has a 1.0 GPA</p>

        <p id="anurudh"><span>Anurudh Ganesan:</span>Unfortunately I was unable to gather information about this individual because his body was too roasted from roast master Aditya Kaliappan. Rest in Peace young soul.</p>
